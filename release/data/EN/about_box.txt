<h1>Pedro Henriques</h1>
Programmer since 2003.

My programming career started as a hobby and with small personal projects. With time I started to appreciate the power of programming to help optimize and automate nearly every aspect of company's operations. This led me to grow my hobby into a full time job and career.

I love all aspects of programming and I'm always searching for the next challenge!
